# Ethereum Block Explorer

Ethereum JSON-RPC API and the `ethers.js` library giving us the ability to query
the Ethereum blockchain and make transactions!

Blockexplorers give us the ability to view lots of different information about
the blockchain including data about:

- the blockchain network itself
- blocks in the blockchain
- transactions in a block
- accounts
- and many other things

[Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/) is a good example of an Ethereum
blockexplorer. Check it out to get familiar with how blockexplorers generally
work.

You can use Etherscan as a guide for features you might consider building in
your project.
